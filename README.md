## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

On this channel I'm a full stack software developer (JS / Python), but I also love filmmaking, cello, and coffee! 
I've gained a deep appreciation for the way that web development combines creativity with logic, and I'm excited to expand further into the mobile/desktop realm.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on scaling my own real-time applications with socket.io
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React Native and Electron

Take a look around here! I always welcome feedback / ideas / opportunities to collaborate.
