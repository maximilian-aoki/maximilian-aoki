## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

On this channel I'm a full stack developer, but I also love filmmaking, cello, and coffee!
I've gained a deep appreciation for the way that web development combines creativity with logic, and I'm excited to expand further into the mobile/desktop realm.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on scaling my own real-time applications with socket.io
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React Native and Electron
